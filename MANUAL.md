# The Cozy Manual

*A small functional array language — user manual for the language, the REPL, and
the tools.*

This manual covers Cozy as implemented: every example below was executed
against the interpreter and shows its actual output. For a quick pitch and build
instructions see the [README](README.md); for the honest list of sharp edges see
[KNOWN_LIMITATIONS](KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md).

## 1. Getting started

Build (a C23 compiler and `libm`; readline optional — see the README for macOS
notes):

```sh
make -j$(nproc)   # ./cozy, the REPL (parallel; plain 'make' works too)
make test         # golden suite + codegen goldens
```

The banner shows the version, when the binary was built, and when the
session started. `cozy --version` prints the same from the command line.
Start the REPL and type an expression; its value echoes back:

```
cozy> 2 + 3 * 4
14
cozy> [1, 2; 3, 4] * [5; 6]
[ 17
   39 ]
```

A trailing `;` evaluates a statement but suppresses the echo. `#` and `%` both
start a comment that runs to end of line. Ctrl-D exits; Ctrl-C cancels the
current input.

## 2. The REPL

The interactive shell adds conveniences on top of the language. None of them
apply to scripts — they are REPL features.

**Commands** (typed bare, not as function calls):

| Command | Effect |
|---|---|
| `help` / `help(f)` | catalogue of all builtins / details plus usage examples for one |
| `who` | your variables, with type and shape; `who("records")`, `who("functions")`, `who("vars")`, add `"sorted"` |
| `whov` / `whof` / `whor` / `whos` | shorthands: vars, functions, records, everything-sorted |
| `version` | the interpreter version, as a string |
| `clear()` / `clear("a", ...)` | remove all user variables / the named ones (builtins are safe) |
| `keep("a", ...)` | remove all user variables *except* the named ones (the complement of `clear`) |
| `mem` | workspace size and peak process memory |
| `format …` | number display: `format("fixed", 2)`, `format(8)` (significant), `format long`, `format` to show |
| `pretty on\|off` | aligned multi-line matrix display (default on in the REPL) |
| `manual [doc]` | page a rendered document: `manual`, `manual packages`, `manual changelog`, `manual lessons`, `manual design` |
| `TAB` | complete builtins, your names, and keywords; inside a `"quoted string"` it completes file paths |
| `more on\|off` | page long output through `$PAGER` (default off) |
| `!cmd` | run a shell command (`!ls`, `!git status`) |
| `dis(f)` | disassemble a function's bytecode |

`keep` names what survives; everything else goes, standard library
untouched:

```
cozy> let rate = 0.0575; let n = 360; let scratch = 99; let tmp = [1, 2, 3];
cozy> keep("rate", "n"); who
  rate         float      = 0.0575
  n            int        = 360
```


Every builtin's help includes executable examples with their actual output —
the examples are machine-verified against the interpreter, like this manual:

```
cozy> help(median)
  median(A) | median(A, dim)
      median of all elements, or along dim
      builtin, 1 to 2 arguments
      e.g.  median([1, 2, 3, 4])              % 2.5
```

**Autocall.** A bare name that is a zero-argument builtin or closure is called:
`who`, `help`, `rand` work without parentheses, and so does your own `let f =
fn -> 42; f`.

**Line editing.** With readline (or macOS libedit), you get history (persisted
to `~/.cozy_history`), completion on builtin and variable names, and the
usual Emacs keys. Multi-line constructs continue with a `     ...>` prompt until
the `end` arrives.

**Display defaults.** The REPL prints matrices as aligned blocks (`pretty on`)
and numbers in a terse 6-significant-digit format; both are configurable — see
[Output and formatting](#13-output-and-formatting).

**The working directory.** `pwd`, `cd("dir")`, and `ls` are ordinary
builtins, so they work bare at the prompt (shell muscle memory intact) *and*
as values: `ls` returns a string array you can pipe, and `cd` actually
changes the interpreter's directory — which `!cd` cannot (the shell escape
runs in a child process). Globs work: `ls("*.cz")`. Flags belong to the
shell escape: `!ls -la`.

```
cozy> ls("packages")
["astro.cz"; "autodiff.cz"; "demo.cz"; "dist.cz"; "finance.cz"; "optim.cz"; "phys.cz"; "poly.cz"; "rmt.cz"; "scatter.cz"; "sparselin.cz"; "symb.cz"]
cozy> cd("packages");
cozy> load("dist.cz"); norm.cdf(0, 0, 1)
0.5
cozy> cd("..");
```

**`ans` — the last value you saw and didn't name.** Every echoed
expression statement rebinds `ans`; `let` statements don't (their result has
a name), semicolon-suppressed statements don't, and `load()`ed scripts don't
(they don't echo). One rule: *if a value printed without a name, it's in
`ans`* — the screen is the spec. `ans` is an ordinary global: it shows in
`who`, `clear("ans")` removes it, and a `let ans = ...` of your own is legal
and simply gets overwritten by your next anonymous result.

```
cozy> 3 + 4
7
cozy> ans * 2
14
cozy> sqrt(ans)
3.74166
cozy> let named = ans
3.74166
cozy> 9 * 9
81
cozy> let x = 1
1
cozy> ans
81
cozy> ans + 100;
cozy> ans
81
cozy> s * 2 where s = 50
100
cozy> ans
100
cozy> who
  ans          int        = 100
  named        float      = 3.74166
  x            int        = 1
```

Note the quiet guarantees in that transcript: `ans` survived both the
`let` and the suppressed statement — it can never hold something you didn't
see — and a `where`-qualified expression sets it like any other, because a
where clause is an anonymous expression, not a named binding. This differs from Octave, where `3 + 4;` sets `ans` silently and
scripts clobber it as a side effect.

## 3. Values and types

**Identifiers** are `[A-Za-z_]` plus any UTF-8 byte above ASCII, then
digits too — so Greek reads naturally: `let α = 0.05`, `let θ = [1; 2]`,
`{μ = 1, σ = 2}.σ`, `minimize(ℓ, θ0)`. Names compare by *bytes*: two
visually identical characters in different Unicode normalizations are
different names (type your α one way). Keywords stay ASCII.

Cozy has twelve value kinds. The scalar kinds:

| Type | Literals | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Int` | `42`, `-7` | 64-bit signed; overflow wraps silently (documented footgun) |
| `Float` | `3.14`, `1e-9`, `2.5e3` | IEEE double |
| `Bool` | `true`, `false` | distinct from numbers: `1 == true` is an error |
| `Complex` | `2i`, `1 + 3i`, `2.5i` | double re/im pair |
| `Dual` | `dual(2, 3)`, prints `2+3eps` | value + derivative pair, `eps^2 = 0`; see the dual numbers section |
| `HDual` | `hdual(3, 1, 1)`, prints `3+1eps1+1eps2+0eps12` | hyper-dual: two nilpotent directions whose product survives, so one pass carries an exact second derivative in the `eps12` slot; `hdual12` reads it — the engine under `hess` and `minimize_newton` |
| `String` | `"hello"` | byte strings: `+` concatenates, comparisons are lexicographic, `s[i]`/`s[a:b]` index bytes (see the Strings section) |
| `Null` | `null` | the "no value" value; a suppressed or valueless statement yields it |

And the compound kinds: `Array` (the 2-D numeric matrix — every array is
rows x cols; a scalar is *not* a 1x1 array), `Record` (`{x = 1, y = 2}`, fields
via `.x`), `Function` (builtins and closures), and `Sparse` (CSR sparse
matrices — see the sparse matrices section).

The type discipline is strict rather than coercive: `Bool` does not silently
become a number in arithmetic or comparison (`1 == true` errors), and mixing
`Bool` with numerics in an array literal is an error. The one deliberate blur:
`Int` and `Float` compare and combine freely (`5 == 5.0` is `true`), and `/`
always produces a `Float` (`4 / 2` is `2.0`).

Floating point behaves like floating point:

```
cozy> 0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3
false
cozy> 5 / 0
inf
```

Division by zero yields `inf`/`nan` rather than an error — test with
`isfinite`/`isnan` where it matters.

## 4. Operators and expressions

From loosest to tightest binding:

| Level | Operators | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| pipe | `\|>` `\|>>` `~>` | left-assoc; see [Functions](#7-functions) |
| logical or | `\|\|` | short-circuit |
| logical and | `&&` | short-circuit |
| elementwise or | `\|` | on logicals/arrays |
| elementwise and | `&` | on logicals/arrays |
| comparison | `== ~= < <= > >=` | elementwise on arrays -> logical array |

**Chained comparisons.** Relational operators chain the way mathematics
writes them: `a < b < c` means `a < b` **and** `b < c`, with the middle
term evaluated exactly once. Chains must run in one direction — `{<, <=}`,
`{>, >=}`, or all `==`; mixing directions is a parse error (write
`(a < b) & (b > c)` for that), and `!=` never chains, because `a != b != c`
would not mean "all distinct". The conjunction is the elementwise `&`, so a
chain over an array is a mask — counting draws in a band is one `sum`:

```
cozy> 0 <= 0.5 < 1
true
cozy> let z = [-1, 0.5, 0.8, 3]; sum(0 < z < 1)
2
cozy> rng(1); sum(-1.96 < randn(1, 100) < 1.96) >= 90
true
```

| range | `a:b`, `a:step:b` | inclusive; float steps fine |
| additive | `+ -` | |
| multiplicative | `* / .* ./ \ .\` | `*` is the **matrix** product on matrices; `.*` elementwise; `\` left division (solve) |
| unary | `- ! ~` | binds looser than `^`: `-2^2` is `-4` |
| power | `^ .^` | right-assoc: `2^3^2` is `512`; `^` on a square matrix is the matrix power |
| postfix | `'` `.'` `f(x)` `a[i]` `.field` | `'` is **conjugate** transpose, `.'` plain |

The `.`-prefixed operators are the elementwise family, exactly as in Octave:

```
cozy> [1, 2, 3] .* [4, 5, 6]
[4, 10, 18]
cozy> 2 .^ [1, 2, 3]
[2, 4, 8]
cozy> [1i, 2]'          # conjugate transpose
[  -1i
  2+0i ]
```

Scalars broadcast against arrays in every elementwise operation (`[1, 2] + 1`
is `[2, 3]`); two arrays must agree in shape exactly.

## 5. Variables and scope

`let name = value` is the binding **statement**: at the top level it creates a
global; inside a loop body or block it creates a local scoped to that construct.
A bare `name = value` (no `let`) is **assignment**: it walks outward through the
enclosing scopes and updates the nearest existing `name` — this is how a loop
body updates an accumulator defined outside it.

`let name = value in body` is the binding **expression**: `name` is visible only
in `body`, and the whole thing evaluates to `body`. Bindings nest and shadow:

```
cozy> let a = 1 in a + (let a = 100 in a) + a
102
```

## 6. Control flow

`if` is an expression:

```
cozy> let x = 5; if x > 3 then "big" else "small" end
"big"
```

The `else` branch is optional; if the condition is false and there is no
`else`, the result is `null`. Conditions must be `Bool` — a number is not a
condition.

Loops are statements (they yield `null`):

```
cozy> let s = 0; for i = 1:10 do s = s + i end; s
55
cozy> let n = 1; while n < 100 do n = n * 2 end; n
128
```

`break` leaves the nearest loop, `continue` skips to its next iteration, and
`return [value]` exits the enclosing function. All three are safe anywhere —
including mid-expression (`acc + (if bad then continue else v end)`): the VM
restores the loop's stack state on a non-local exit.

**Block expressions** sequence statements inside parentheses; the value is the
final expression, and `let` bindings are local to the block:

```
cozy> (let x = 3; let y = 4; sqrt(x*x + y*y))
5
cozy> (let q = 7; q); q
error: undefined name 'q'          % block locals do not leak
```

This is the natural shape for a multi-step function body.

### `elseif` (since 2.19)

Chains share a single closing `end`; each condition is tried in order:

```
cozy> if 1 > 2 then "a" elseif 3 > 2 then "c" else "d" end
"c"
cozy> let sign_ = fn x -> if x < 0 then -1 elseif x == 0 then 0 else 1 end
<fn/1>
cozy> [sign_(-7), sign_(0), sign_(4)]
[-1, 0, 1]
```

## 7. Functions

`fn params -> expr` is a lambda; its body is one expression (use a block
expression or `let … in` for multiple steps). Functions are values: bind them,
pass them, return them.

```
cozy> let f = fn x -> x ^ 2 + 1; f(3)
10
cozy> let add = fn a -> fn b -> a + b; add(2)(5)   # currying
7
cozy> let g = fn x -> (let s = x * x; s + 1); g(4)
17
```

Closures capture by value at creation. Recursion works through the function's
own name.

**Sections.** A parenthesised expression containing `_` becomes a lambda; each
`_` is a fresh parameter, left to right: `(_ + 1)` is `fn x -> x + 1`,
`(_ * _)` takes two arguments.

**map.** `map(f, A)` applies `f` elementwise: `map((_ * 10), [1, 2, 3])` is
`[10, 20, 30]`.

**The pipe.** `x |> rhs` feeds a value forward. If `rhs` mentions `@`, the pipe
binds `@` to `x` and evaluates `rhs`; if `rhs` is a bare callable, the pipe
applies it:

```
cozy> [1, 2, 3, 4] |> sum(@) |> sqrt
3.16228
cozy> 5 |> @ + 1
6
cozy> 9 |> sqrt              # bare callable: sqrt(9)
3
```

**Index-bound reductions.** Sigma notation, executable: `f[k = R] E`
applies any callable `f` to the body `E` evaluated at each `k` in `R` —
sugar for `R ~> (fn k -> E) |> f`, so `sum`, `prod`, `max`, `mean`, or your
own function all reduce. The binder is scoped to the body; the body binds
loose, exactly like a `fn` body, so `sum[k = 1:3] k + 1` sums `k + 1`
per term — parenthesize the reduction to operate on its result, and
likewise to qualify the range with a `where`:
`(sum[k = 1:n] k ^ 2) where n = 3`.

```
cozy> sum[k = 1:100] 1 / k ^ 2
1.63498
cozy> pi ^ 2 / 6
1.64493
cozy> let q = [0.1, 0.2, 0.15]; prod[j = 1:3] (1 - q[j])
0.612
cozy> sum[i = 1:4] sum[j = 1:4] (i == j)
4
```

**Where clauses.** Any expression can name its constants after the fact, the
way mathematics writes them: `expr where a = 1, b = -3`. Bindings are
sequential (later ones may use earlier ones — not vice versa), scoped to that
one expression (they never leak, and they shadow without damaging outer
names), and the clause binds looser than everything else in the expression,
so a whole pipeline can be qualified at its end. It is pure sugar for a
`let..in` chain. The former `where(...)` builtin is now `find(mask)` (indices
of true) and `pick(mask, a, b)` (elementwise select).

```
cozy> let y = a * x ^ 2 + b * x + c where a = 1, b = -3, c = 2, x = 4
6
cozy> sqrt(h) where hs = 3, h = hs + 1
2
cozy> 1:n ~> (@ ^ 2) |> sum where n = 5
55
cozy> b
```

Pipes chain left to right, which reads as a data-flow pipeline.

**The elementwise pipe `~>`.** Where `|>` feeds the *whole* value, `~>` feeds
each *element*: `x ~> f` is `map(f, x)`. The same right-hand-side rules apply,
with one deliberate twist: under `~>`, `@` binds the **element**, not the whole
array. The operator extends the whole-vs-elementwise distinction
(`*` vs `.*`) to pipelines. (In Neutrino, Cozy's ancestor, it was said the
elementwise pipe oscillates; the pun retires with the name — the operator
does not.) `~>` always means the map primitive itself, so
shadowing the name `map` cannot change what the operator does.

```
cozy> [0.5, 1.5, 2.5] ~> (@ * 2) ~> floor
[1, 3, 5]
cozy> 1:5 ~> (@ ^ 2) |> sum
55
cozy> [1, 2, 3] ~> (fn x -> x * 10)
[10, 20, 30]
```

**The tee pipe `|>>`.** Exactly `|>`, but the value flowing through is printed
(echo style) before being passed on — pipeline debugging without dismantling
the pipeline. Swap `|>` for `|>>` at the stage you want to watch, then swap
back:

```
cozy> [3, 1, 4, 1, 5] |>> sort |>> unique |> length
[3, 1, 4, 1, 5]
[1, 1, 3, 4, 5]
4
```

**Fan-out.** When the right-hand side of `|>` (or `|>>`) is a record literal,
each field's callable is applied to the piped value, and the result is a
record of results with the same keys — a `describe()` composed from syntax:

```
cozy> [2.1, 3.7, 1.4, 5.0] |> {n = length, mu = mean, sd = std, top = max}
{n = 4, mu = 3.05, sd = 1.61761, top = 5}
```

Fan-out is one level deep and whole-value only (`~>` into a record is an
error). A non-callable field is a type error, and `@` inside the fan-out
record is rejected: each field already receives the piped value as its
argument.


## 8. Arrays and matrices

Matrix literals use `,` between columns and `;` between rows; every array is
two-dimensional and **1-indexed**. `[]` is the empty array.

**Indexing** supports scalars, ranges, `:` (everything along a dimension),
`end` (the last index, with arithmetic), index vectors (gather), and logical
masks:

```
cozy> let A = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6]
[ 1  2  3
  4  5  6 ]
cozy> size(A)
[2, 3]
cozy> A[2, 3]          # element
6
cozy> A[1, :]          # row
[1, 2, 3]
cozy> A[:, 2]          # column
[ 2
  5 ]
cozy> A[end, end]
6
cozy> let v = [10, 20, 30, 40]; v[2:3]
[20, 30]
cozy> v[v > 15]        # logical mask
[20, 30, 40]
cozy> v[[1, 4]]        # gather
[10, 40]
```

**Indexed assignment** works with the same selectors, copy-on-write:
`A[1, 2] = 9`, `v[v < 0] = 0`, `A[2, :] = [7, 8, 9]`. The target must be a
plain name and indices must be in range (no auto-growing).

`unique(A)` returns the sorted distinct elements — vectors keep their
orientation, matrices flatten to a row. **Logical arrays** come from comparisons and drive masking and counting:
`sum(A > 2)` counts, `any`/`all` test, `find(mask)` gives 1-based positions,
`pick(mask, a, b)` selects elementwise.

**Construction and reshaping**: `zeros`, `ones`, `eye`, `diag`, `linspace`,
`reshape` (row-major), `repmat`, ranges `1:n`. **Reductions** take an optional
dimension: `sum(A, 1)` down columns, `sum(A, 2)` across rows,
`max(A, [], dim)` for the extrema.

**Descriptive statistics** follow the same conventions. `var` and `std`
normalize by N-1 by default (`var(A, 1)` divides by N), `median` handles even
counts by averaging, and `quantile` uses linear interpolation between order
statistics (the NumPy default):

```
cozy> let x = [2, 7, 4, 9, 3]
cozy> var(x)
8.5
cozy> quantile(x, [0.25, 0.5, 0.75])
[3, 4, 7]
```

`cov(X)` and `corr(X)` treat a matrix's **columns as variables** and rows as
observations, returning the p x p covariance / Pearson correlation matrix
(`cov` takes the same `w` normalization as `var`). On two vectors they return
the scalar: `cov(x, y)`, `corr(x, y)`. A constant column has no correlation to
speak of — those entries are `nan`:

```
cozy> corr([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [2, 1, 4, 3, 5])
0.8
```

## 9. Linear algebra

`*` is the matrix product; `\` solves. Square systems use LU with partial
pivoting; non-square `\` is least squares — overdetermined gives the LS fit,
underdetermined the minimum-norm solution.

```
cozy> [2, 1; 1, 3] \ [3; 5]
[ 0.8
  1.4 ]
cozy> [1, 1; 1, 2; 1, 3] \ [1; 2; 2]     # regression: intercept, slope
[ 0.666667
       0.5 ]
```

The decompositions return records, so the pieces have names:

| Call | Returns | Identity |
|---|---|---|
| `lu(A)` | `{L, U, p}` | `P*A = L*U` |
| `qr(A)` | `{Q, R}` | `A = Q*R` |
| `chol(A)` | `L` | `L*L' = A` (Hermitian PD) |
| `svd(A)` | `{U, S, V}` | `A = U*diag(S)*V'` |
| `eig(A)` | `{values, vectors}` | `A*V = V*diag(values)` |

`eig` handles both Hermitian matrices (Jacobi; real ascending eigenvalues,
orthonormal vectors) and general ones (complex QR + inverse iteration; complex
pairs come out right). All of it is complex-capable — `'` being the conjugate
transpose is what makes the identities hold. `kron(A, B)` is the Kronecker
product, `det`, `inv`, `trace`, `norm`, `dot` round out the set.

## 10. Complex numbers

The imaginary literal is a number followed by `i`. Complex values propagate
through arithmetic and the math library; results stay complex (`1i * 1i` is
`-1+0i`, not `-1`). `real`, `imag`, `conj`, `angle` access the parts, `abs` is
the modulus. Functions with limited real domains return complex off it:
`sqrt(-4)` is `2i`, `log(-1)` is `3.14159i`, `asin(2)` is complex.

## 10b. Dual numbers and exact derivatives

A dual number is `a + b*eps` with `eps^2 = 0` — the derivative-carrying
sibling of complex. `dual(a, b)` builds one (elementwise over arrays),
`dualval`/`dualeps` read the parts, and both accessors are total on plain
numbers (`dualval(7)` is `7`, `dualeps(7)` is `0`), so a function whose
branch returns a constant still differentiates. Arithmetic and the whole
transcendental library apply the chain rule exactly: no step size, no
differencing. Comparisons read the value part, so conditionals inside a
differentiated function take the branch the values take (the derivative
of `abs` at its kink is one-sided). Dual and complex do not mix — that
is the promotion law, and mixing them is an error naming `dualval`.
The dense linear-algebra kernels (`eig`, `svd`, `\`, `det`, `norm`)
gate on dual matrices; autodiff flows through elementwise ops, `*`,
and reductions, which is what objective functions are made of.

```
cozy> dual(3, 1) * dual(3, 1)
9+6eps
cozy> sin(dual(0, 1))
1eps
cozy> dualeps(sqrt(dual(4, 1)))
0.25
```

**Hyper-duals carry second derivatives**: `hdual(x, s1, s2)` seeds two
directions at once (`eps1^2 = eps2^2 = 0`, their product survives), and
`hdual12` reads the exact mixed partial from one pass — `hdual12(hdual(3,
1, 1)^2)` is exactly `2`. The same promotion law applies twice over:
hyper-dual mixes with neither complex nor dual. `gamma`/`lgamma` refuse
hyper-duals (their second derivative needs trigamma — a recorded
residue).

`load("packages/autodiff.cz")` turns all of this into `d(f)`, `grad(f)`,
and `hess(f)` — see the packages guide.

## 11. Special functions and statistics

The special-function set is chosen as *primitives* from which the classical
distributions are one-liners:

```
cozy> let normcdf = fn x -> 0.5 * erfc(-x / sqrt(2))
cozy> normcdf(1.96)
0.975002
cozy> norminv(0.975)
1.95996
```

`gammainc(x, a)` is the regularized lower incomplete gamma — the chi-square CDF
is `gammainc(x/2, k/2)`. `betainc(x, a, b)` is the regularized incomplete beta —
Student-t and F CDFs fall out of it. `erf`/`erfc`, `beta`/`lbeta`,
`gamma`/`lgamma`, `digamma`, and integer-order Bessel `besselj`/`bessely`
complete the set. All are real-domain, elementwise over arrays, and validated
against SciPy.

### Root finding, minimization, integration

These three take a **function argument** — a closure or builtin — and call it
repeatedly. `fzero(f, a, b)` finds a root by Brent's method (`f(a)` and `f(b)`
must differ in sign); `fminbnd(f, a, b)` minimizes on an interval and returns
`{x, fx}`; `integral(f, a, b[, tol])` integrates adaptively (Simpson with
Richardson estimate; finite limits; default tolerance 1e-10). Closures capture
data, so parameterized problems read naturally — a bond's yield to maturity:

```
cozy> let cf = [100, 100, 100, 1100]
cozy> let npv = fn r -> sum(cf ./ ((1 + r) .^ (1:4))) - 1000
cozy> format(6); fzero(npv, 0.01, 0.3)
0.100000
```

A divergent or wildly oscillatory integrand fails with an error rather than a
wrong answer; infinite limits are rejected — substitute to a finite domain
first.

### Strings

Strings are byte sequences (UTF-8 passes through but is not interpreted;
`length` and indexing count bytes). `+` concatenates; `==`, `!=`, `<` and
friends compare lexicographically, shorter prefixes first; indexing uses the
same machinery as arrays, so ranges, `end`, and even permutations work:

```
cozy> let s = "cozy"
"cozy"
cozy> s[1:3] + "!" + s[end]
"coz!y"
cozy> "apple" < "banana"
true
```

The library: `upper`, `lower`, `trim`, `contains(s, sub)`,
`startswith(s, p)`, `endswith(s, p)`, `strrep(s, old, new)`. Two bridges:
`str(x)` gives any value's display text as a string, `num(s)` parses a
string as a number (Int if exact, else Float). And `fmt(tmpl, ...)` is
`print`'s template engine returning a string instead of printing:

```
cozy> fmt("run {} done in {:.2f}s", 3, 1.234)
"run 3 done in 1.23s"
```

Strings also form **arrays**: `["a", "bb"; "c", "dd"]` is a 2x2 String
matrix (mixing strings with numbers in one matrix is an error). Indexing,
slicing, `end`, transpose, `reshape`, `sort`, and `unique` all work, and
elementwise operations do what a data-frame user hopes:

```
cozy> let names = ["si", "at", "de", "si"]
cozy> names == "si"
[true, false, false, true]
cozy> names[names == "si"]
["si", "si"]
cozy> ["pre_", "un_"] + "fix"
["pre_fix", "un_fix"]
```

Numeric reductions (`min`, `max`, `sum`, `norm`, …) refuse string arrays
rather than computing nonsense, and assignment cannot mix kinds: a String
cell never silently becomes a number, nor the reverse.

`strsplit(s, sep)` and `strjoin(a, sep)` convert between strings and string
arrays; `fields(r)` returns a record's field names as a string column;
`readtable` loads non-numeric CSV columns as string arrays (quoted cells,
RFC-4180 style, are handled); `writecsv` writes string matrices with proper
quoting; and plots take `{labels = ["low", "high"]}` for multi-series
legends alongside the older `label1`, `label2`, … form.

String-and-number arithmetic is still an error — there is no implicit
conversion in either direction; use `str` and `num` to cross the bridge.

### Where, not just whether: `strfind` — and dynamic record fields

`contains` says whether a pattern occurs; `strfind(s, pat)` says where —
every 1-based start position (overlapping occurrences count), `[]` if
none. Since strings index like arrays, pattern-directed slicing is now a
one-liner instead of a character scan. And the record reflection pair
closes the mirror-image gap: `getfield(r, name)` reads a field named at
runtime (strict error if absent, like literal access), and
`setfield(r, name, v)` returns a *new* record with the field replaced or
appended — records stay immutable values, and construction is a fold:
grow `{}` one `setfield` at a time. Generic column statistics, record
merge, k=v parsing, and serialization round-trips now live in packages.

```
cozy> let s = "key=value"; s[strfind(s, "=")[1]+1 : end]
"value"
cozy> strfind("mississippi", "ss")
[3; 6]
cozy> let t = {yr = [2024; 2025], cpi = [3.1; 2.4]}; fields(t) ~> (fn nm -> mean(getfield(t, nm)))
[2024.5; 2.75]
cozy> fields({} |> setfield(@, "lo", 1) |> setfield(@, "hi", 2))
["lo"; "hi"]
```

### Packages: `load`

`load("file.cz")` runs a file in the current session; its `let` bindings
persist afterwards. A package is just a file of definitions — and a record
of closures makes a namespace, so packages don't collide. Namespaces need
no new machinery: `fields(r)` is the manifest, `getfield(r, name)` the
dynamic door, and sibling fields may call each other through the record's
own global name (`stats.z` calling `stats.se` works, because functions
resolve globals at call time). The same late binding is the one law worth
memorizing: **a record namespace hides the face, never the body** — a
field's body still resolves its helpers as globals at call time, so
`keep()` of the record alone strands every call on `undefined name`. The
standard packages therefore tag-prefix their helpers (`op_`, `ad_`,
`sl_`); the full authoring convention is in the packages guide under
"Writing your own". Example:

```
cozy> load("tests/data/mathlib.cz")
cozy> cube(4)
64
cozy> geo.hyp([3, 4])
5
```

`save("ws.cz")` writes the whole workspace — every variable and function —
as reloadable source; restore it with `load("ws.cz")`. The file is plain
Cozy, so it is readable and editable. Functions that capture variables
(closures made by other functions) cannot be serialized and refuse with a
clear message; a failed save leaves no file behind. `body(f)` prints a
function's retained source, and `ast(f)` goes one further — the body as a
walkable record tree ({op, l, r, ...}, symb-compatible), which is how the
book's Taylor problem differentiates `sin` symbolically seven times.
`body(f)` prints the
source of a user-defined function:

```
cozy> let cube = fn x -> x^3
cozy> body(cube)
fn x -> x^3
```

Expressions may span lines wherever a `(`, `[`, or `{` is open — newlines
there are plain whitespace (matrix rows still take an explicit `;`). At the
top level a newline ends the statement, and the REPL reads continuation
lines automatically while a bracket is open.

Packages validate their inputs with `error` and `assert`:

```
cozy> let f = fn x -> (assert(x > 0, "f needs x > 0, got {}", x); sqrt(x))
cozy> f(-4)
error: f needs x > 0, got -4
```

The standard packages — distributions, polynomials, finance, and the solar almanac — are documented with verified examples in PACKAGES.md. Packages can `load` other packages (nesting is capped, so circular loads
error cleanly). Closures capture by value, so packages are libraries of
functions rather than stateful modules. Errors inside a loaded file are
reported with the file name; a parse error includes its line and column
within the file.

### Masks and reductions

Comparisons on arrays yield Bool masks, and the reductions treat
`true` as 1: `sum` of a mask counts, `mean` of a mask is the fraction —
the one-line statistic for any condition.

```
cozy> let mask = [1, 5, 2, 8, 3] > 2.5
[false, true, false, true, true]
cozy> sum(mask)
3
cozy> mean(mask)
0.6
```

## 12. Random numbers

The generator is xoshiro256** seeded through splitmix64, and it is
**reproducible by default**: every fresh session starts from the same fixed
seed, so a script's random draws are stable run to run. `rng(seed)` reseeds —
same seed, same stream. `rand`, `randn`, `randi` draw uniform, normal, and
integer variates, scalar or matrix-shaped (`rand(3)`, `randn(2, 4)`).

## 13. Plotting

Plotting has three backends. **Natively** the default is **gnuplot**, out of
process — a soft dependency: the language works without it, and `plot`
reports cleanly if it is missing (`plot: gnuplot failed (exit 127) — is
gnuplot installed?`). Setting `COZY_PLOT_TERM=ascii` renders
deterministic text plots into the terminal instead, and
`COZY_PLOT_TERM=svg` writes standalone `plot_N.svg` files (dark
palette). In the **browser** the default is the SVG backend, rendered into
the workbench's Plots pane. For scatter plots, `packages/scatter.cz` wraps
the `style = "points"` path every backend honors.

`plot(y)` plots a vector against its index; `plot(x, y)` plots pairs; if `y` is
a **matrix**, each column is a separate series. An optional trailing argument is
either a gnuplot style string (`"points"`, `"lines lw 2"`, `"impulses"`) or an
options record. The svg and ascii backends honor the marker family by
substring — any style mentioning `point`, `circle`, or `dot` draws markers,
everything else draws lines — so `"circle"` means the same thing on every
backend:

```
cozy> let x = linspace(0, 10, 200)
cozy> plot(x, map(sin, x), {title = "sin(x)", xlabel = "x", grid = true})
```

Recognised options: `title`, `xlabel`, `ylabel`, `style` (strings); `logx`,
`logy`, `grid` (booleans); `xrange`, `yrange` (`[lo, hi]` vectors) to fix an
axis instead of letting gnuplot choose; and legend labels — `label` for a
single series, `label1`, `label2`, ... for several (unlabeled series keep the
`series k` default):

```
cozy> let t = (linspace(0, 6.28, 100))';
cozy> plot(t, [map(sin, t), map(cos, t)], {label1 = "sin", label2 = "cos"})
``` `hist(y)` draws a histogram
(`hist(y, nbins)` to choose the bin count; the default follows Sturges' rule),
and accepts the same trailing options record:

```
cozy> rng(7)
cozy> hist(randn(1, 5000), 40)
```

A word of caution that `yrange` exists to address: gnuplot auto-ranges the
y-axis to the data, which can make pure sampling noise look like structure. A
histogram of 100 000 uniform draws in 20 bins has bin counts of 5000 +/- 69
(one binomial standard deviation) — auto-ranged, that +/-1.4% wiggle fills the
whole plot and looks alarming; anchored at zero it is the flat wall it should
be:

```
cozy> hist(rand(1, 100000), 20, {yrange = [0, 6000]})
```

Plots open in a gnuplot window that outlives the command (`gnuplot -persist`).
For scripted rendering, two environment variables redirect output —
`COZY_PLOT_TERM` sets the gnuplot terminal and `COZY_PLOT_OUT` the
file:

```sh
COZY_PLOT_TERM="pngcairo size 800,500" COZY_PLOT_OUT=fig.png \
  ./cozy script.cz
```

(`COZY_PLOT_TERM="dumb size 76,20"` draws ASCII plots straight into the
terminal, which is occasionally exactly what you want.) Complex data is
rejected — plot `real(z)`, `imag(z)`, or `abs(z)` explicitly.

## 14. Data files

`readcsv(file)` reads a numeric CSV into a Float matrix; `writecsv(file, A)`
writes one at full precision, so values **round-trip bit-exactly**. Empty
cells become `nan` (missing data), Windows line endings are tolerated, and
`{delim = ";", skip = n}` options handle other separators and preamble lines.
Ragged rows and non-numeric cells are errors that name the row and column.

`readtable(file)` reads a CSV whose first line is a header and returns a
**record of column vectors**, keys sanitized from the column names
(`"GDP Growth (%)"` becomes `gdp_growth`; duplicates get `_2`, `_3`, ...).
This is Cozy's data frame — named columns plus the existing mask
machinery:

```
cozy> writecsv("/tmp/m.csv", [1, 2; 3, 4]); readcsv("/tmp/m.csv")
[ 1  2
  3  4 ]
```

```
cozy> let d = readtable("tests/data/macro.csv")
cozy> mean(d.gdp_growth)
1.93333
cozy> d.cpi[d.year >= 2021]
[  nan
     8 ]
```

For a headerless file use `readcsv` — `readtable` will take the first line as
a header regardless of its content. A column containing text (country names,
tickers) is rejected with an error naming the column: representing it needs
first-class strings, which the language does not yet have.

## 15. Output and formatting

Number display has one rule worth internalizing: **`format(n)` sets
significant digits** (printf `%g`), which is why `format(2)` shows
100.51 as `1.0e+02` — two significant digits genuinely cannot spell
100.51. When you want *decimals* — bills, prices, fixed-width tables —
say so explicitly with the systematic two-argument form:

- `format("fixed", d)` — d digits after the point (`%f`): the bill mode.
- `format("sci", d)` — scientific with d decimals (`%e`).
- `format("auto", d)` — d significant digits (`%g`); `format(d)` is its
  shorthand.
- `format` with no arguments reports the current setting;
  `format("default")` restores the terse startup style. The Octave-style
  names (`"short"`, `"long"`, `"short f"`, `"long f"`, `"short e"`,
  `"long e"`) remain as presets.

```
cozy> let bill = 87.40; bill * 1.15
100.51
cozy> format(2)
cozy> bill * 1.15
1.0e+02
cozy> format("fixed", 2)
cozy> bill * 1.15
100.51
cozy> ans / 4
25.13
cozy> format("sci", 3)
cozy> ans
2.513e+01
cozy> format
format: scientific, 3 decimals
cozy> format("default")
```

Strings interpolate with `fmt`, and `print` shares its template
semantics (`{}` placeholders; double the braces for literals).

## 15b. Strings as code, and the keyboard (since 2.19)

`eval` runs a string as Cozy code in the current session and returns
its last value — which, among other things, gives dynamic record access:
`eval("w." + col)`. `names` is the programmatic sibling of the `who`
family (whose printed tables are unchanged): your workspace names as a
sorted string column, with `"vars"`/`"funcs"` selectors.

```
cozy> eval("2 + 2")
4
cozy> let w = {temp = [21.5; 19.8], rain = [0; 4.2]};
cozy> let col = "temp"; eval("w." + col)
[21.5; 19.8]
cozy> let a = 1; let f = fn x -> x; names("vars")
["a"; "ans"; "col"; "w"]
cozy> names("funcs")
["f"]
```

`input("prompt")` reads one line from the keyboard as a string, and
`pause()` waits for Enter — `window.prompt` and an alert in the browser.
Interactive by nature, so shown here rather than machine-replayed (under
a pipe they consume the next stdin line; `tests/run_io.sh` checks exactly
that):

```
let name = input("who are you? ");
print("hello, " + name)
pause("press Enter for the plot...")
```

### Binding builtins: functions are values, commands autocall

`version` is a function; `let v = version` stores *the function* (like
`let s = sin`), which `whof` lists. A bare zero-argument builtin —
including through an alias — autocalls at the top level and prints its
result; in argument position it does not, so `length(v)` measures the
function value (1). To store the *result*, call it: `let w = version()`
— then `w` is an ordinary string variable. (The version string itself is
suppressed below with `;` so this page never goes stale.)

```
cozy> let v = version
<builtin version>
cozy> whof
  v            builtin
cozy> length(v)
1
cozy> let w = version();
cozy> w == version()
true
cozy> names("vars")
["ans"; "w"]
```

### Which kernels answered: buildinfo

`buildinfo()` returns a record identifying the build: `backend` names the
linear-algebra kernel table linked into this binary (`"tier0"` is the
zero-dependency hand-rolled set; accelerated backends are a build-time
choice — `make BACKEND=...` — never a language-visible one), `version`
matches `version()`, and `built` embeds the compile date and time. A
production tool whose user cannot tell an accelerated backend from the
fallback kernels is not verifiable; this is the introspection that makes
the difference visible. Build with `make BACKEND=openblas` for LAPACK-backed kernels
(`eig(rand(300))` measured ~158x faster than the hand-rolled tier0);
`make` alone keeps the zero-dependency tier0. Either way the language is
identical — the conformance suite passes byte-for-byte under both.

Optimization has the same shape of choice, orthogonal to the linear
algebra: `make OPTIM=nlopt` (Debian/Ubuntu: `libnlopt-dev`; macOS: `brew
install nlopt`) links NLopt and enables the `nlmin` builtin — SLSQP,
L-BFGS, BOBYQA, and COBYLA behind one options record, with gradients and
constraint Jacobians supplied EXACTLY by Cozy's dual numbers rather than
finite differences. `minimize_con` and `maximize_con` in the optim
package dispatch to SLSQP automatically when `buildinfo().optim` says
`"nlopt"`; without the backend they run the pure augmented-Lagrangian
path, which is also what the browser build ships. `minimize_newton`
never dispatches: exact hyper-dual Newton is native Cozy either way.

The optimizers also have a binder surface, the index-bound notation
generalized from sigma: `minimize[x = x0] f(x)` reads as mathematics and
desugars to `minimize(fn x -> f(x), x0)` — likewise `maximize` and
`nlmin`. For every other callable, `f[k = R] E` keeps its reduction
meaning; the optimizer names are special-cased because a minimization
binds a starting point, not a range.
(The transcript below shows only the record's
shape: the backend name varies by build and the timestamp by the minute,
so this page never goes stale.)

```
cozy> fields(buildinfo())
["backend"; "version"; "built"; "optim"]
cozy> let b = buildinfo();
cozy> b.version == version()
true
```

### Sparse matrices

A sparse matrix is its own kind of value — CSR storage, float or complex —
built by `sparse(A)` from a dense matrix or `sparse(i, j, v, m, n)` from
1-based triplets (duplicates summed, zeros never stored), plus `speye(n)`,
`sprand(m, n, d)`, and `sprandn(m, n, d)` (both drawing from the session's
reproducible RNG). `dense(S)` crosses back; `nnz` counts stored entries;
`who` shows `sparse RxC, nnz = N`. The promotion law is stated once:
zero-preserving operations stay sparse (`S + S`, `S .* S`, `k * S`, `-S`,
`S'`), the founding kernel is sparse-matrix × dense-column (`S * v`), and
anything that would silently densify — `S + 1`, `S == S`, `S \ b` — is an
error that names the way through (`dense(S)` if you meant it). Iterative
solvers built on `S * v` are the intended path for large systems. Indexing
reads are scalar for now: `S[i, j]`.

```
cozy> let S = sparse([0, 5; 3, 0]); S
sparse 2x2, nnz = 2
  (1,2)  5
  (2,1)  3
cozy> S * [10; 100]
[500; 30]
cozy> let T = sparse([1; 2; 2], [1; 1; 2], [4; 7; 9], 3, 3); nnz(T)
3
cozy> nnz(sprand(100, 100, 0.05))
500
```

## 16. Scripts and tools

`cozy file.cz` runs a script (top level is a statement sequence; `#`/`%`
comments). The binary also exposes the compiler pipeline:

| Invocation | Shows |
|---|---|
| `cozy --tokens file.cz` | the token stream |
| `cozy --ast file.cz` | the parse tree |
| `cozy --dis file.cz` | the compiled bytecode, statement by statement |

`tic` starts a monotonic wall-clock timer and `toc()` returns the elapsed
seconds — bare `toc` as a statement echoes it, but in an expression position
write `toc()` (a bare name is a value reference, as with any function):

```
cozy> tic; let A = randn(100, 100); let B = A * A; toc() < 60
true
```

`vmtest` is the headless driver used by the test suite: it reads stdin line by
line and echoes each result, so `printf 'sum(1:100)\n' | ./vmtest` prints
`5050`. `dis(f)` disassembles from inside the language. The golden suite
(`make test`) and its ASan twin (`make test-asan`) are how changes prove
themselves; `tests/dis/` pins the emitted bytecode for core constructs.

**SVG plots.** `COZY_PLOT_TERM=svg` makes `plot` and `hist` write
`plot_N.svg` files instead of using gnuplot or ASCII. The browser build uses
this by default: plots appear in the page's Plots panel, and "download new
files" saves them.

## Editors

**Emacs.** `editors/cozy-mode.el` provides a major mode for `.cz` files:
syntax highlighting (the builtin list is generated from the interpreter's own
documentation table, so it cannot drift), `%` comments, block-aware
indentation, and an inferior REPL. Put the file on your `load-path` and
`(require 'cozy-mode)`; then `M-x run-cozy` starts the REPL, and from
any `.cz` buffer `C-c C-r` sends the region, `C-c C-b` the buffer,
`C-c C-l` loads the file, `C-c C-z` jumps to the REPL. On GitHub, a
`.gitattributes` rule highlights `.cz` as Octave — close enough until
linguist learns Cozy.

### The workspace stays readable: load groups

`load` remembers which names each file defined, and `who` collapses
every loaded file to one summary line — so after a package-heavy
session your own definitions stay findable at a glance. `who("name")`
(the file's basename, or its full path) opens a shelf in full;
`who("all")` restores the flat listing; the kind filters
(`who("functions")`, `who("vars")`, ...) remain flat, as before.

```
cozy> load("packages/scatter.cz")
cozy> let zq = 5
5
cozy> who
  packages/scatter.cz      3 names   (who("scatter") to list)
  zq           int        = 5
cozy> who("scatter")
  scatter      function   (2 params)
  scatter_titled function   (3 params)
  jitter       function   (2 params)
```

Re-loading a file replaces its shelf; `clear`ed names drop from the
counts; and `clear("scatter")` unloads a whole shelf — every member
removed, the summary line gone, your own names untouched (a variable
with the same name as a shelf wins the dispute). The registry follows
names, not values — a rebound name stays on its shelf.

```
cozy> load("packages/scatter.cz")
cozy> let zq = 5
5
cozy> clear("scatter"); who
  packages/scatter.cz      2 names   (who("scatter") to list)
  zq           int        = 5
```


## 17. Builtin reference
